# Edu Students App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
Technologies that I used: React Hooks, React Router Dom, JS Cookie, Axios, Sass, React Hook Form, MobX.
The app has home and login page for guests. Authorized users can use Home page with subject tabs and students list. Authorized users can add new students on each subject tab. There is log out button on side nav.

### `npm install`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
